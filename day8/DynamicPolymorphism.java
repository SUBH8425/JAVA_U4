/*
   Dynamic polymorphism is a process or mechanism in which a call to an overridden 
   method is to resolve at runtime rather than compile-time. It is also known as runtime
   polymorphism or dynamic method dispatch. We can achieve dynamic polymorphism by using
   the method overriding.
   In this process, an overridden method is called through a reference variable of a superclass.
   The determination of the method to be called is based on the object being referred to
   by the reference variable.
